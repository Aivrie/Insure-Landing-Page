# Insure Landing Page Challenge

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi There! :wave:
This is my task build for the Frontend Mentor challenge (A Landing Page for a Company, Insure)

The challenge was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The images in the `/images` folder have been optimised for desktop and mobile versions.

The `style-guide.md` file contains the information for the color palette and fonts.

## Testing RWD (Responsive Web Design)
1. Open `index.html` file in browser.

2. Right click and click on `inspect element`

3. Change device size from the top of browser to test responsiveness across screen sizes

**Yay!!! Thanks for stopping by :rocket:**
